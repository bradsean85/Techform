- Role-based access control (admin vs regular user)
- Secure token validation middleware

### Input Sanitization
- HTML entity escaping for string inputs
- JSON validation for specifications
- File type validation for uploads
- Parameter validation for all endpoints

### Error Security
- No sensitive information in error responses
- Consistent error format across all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **30 test cases** covering all endpoints and scenarios
- Unit tests for individual endpoint functionality
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Error handling tests
- Authentication and authorization tests
- File upload and deletion tests

### Test Coverage
- ✅ GET /api/products with various filters
- ✅ GET /api/products/:id for specific products
- ✅ POST /api/products for product creation
- ✅ PUT /api/products/:id for product updates
- ✅ DELETE /api/products/:id for product deletion
- ✅ Image upload and management endpoints
- ✅ Authentication and authorization scenarios
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Database error simulation

## Requirements Mapping

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 1.1 | GET /api/products with filtering | ✅ Complete |
| 1.2 | Search functionality in products endpoint | ✅ Complete |
| 1.3 | GET /api/products/:id for detailed view | ✅ Complete |
| 4.2 | POST /api/products for admin product creation | ✅ Complete |
| 4.3 | PUT /api/products/:id for admin product updates | ✅ Complete |
| 4.4 | DELETE /api/products/:id for admin product deletion | ✅ Complete |

## Usage Examples

### Get all products
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/products"
```

### Search products
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/products?search=Neural&category=neural-tech"
```

### Get specific product
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/products/1"
```

### Create product (admin only)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "New Gadget",
    "description": "Amazing new tech",
    "price": 299.99,
    "category": "gadgets",
    "inventory": 10
  }'
```

## Integration Status

## Next Steps - Task 5: Shopping Cart Functionality

The next phase involves developing the shopping cart functionality, which will build upon the product API we just implemented. Here's what needs to be done:

### 5.1 Cart Data Model
- Create Cart and CartItem database models
- Implement cart persistence for authenticated users
- Design localStorage strategy for guest users

### 5.2 Cart API Endpoints
- `GET /api/cart` - Retrieve user's cart
- `POST /api/cart/items` - Add product to cart
- `PUT /api/cart/items/:id` - Update item quantity
- `DELETE /api/cart/items/:id` - Remove item from cart
- `DELETE /api/cart` - Clear entire cart

### 5.3 Cart Synchronization
- Implement cart sync between localStorage and server
- Handle cart merging when guest users log in
- Manage cart state across browser sessions

### 5.4 Integration Points with Product API
- Validate product availability when adding to cart
- Check inventory levels during cart operations
- Fetch current product prices and details
- Handle product updates affecting cart items

### 5.5 Frontend Cart Management
- Create CartManager class for client-side operations
- Implement cart UI components and interactions
- Add cart persistence indicators
- Build cart synchronization logic

### Requirements to Address
- **2.1**: Add products to shopping cart
- **2.2**: View and modify cart contents  
- **2.3**: Persist cart across sessions
- **6.1**: Cart data management and synchronization

The shopping cart implementation will leverage the robust product API we've built, ensuring seamless integration between product browsing and cart management functionality.
